                <li>
                    <strong>1917-1919: </strong>
                    He was elected Chairman of the municipality from 1917 to 1919 and during which time he was

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1919: </strong>
                    After Mahatma Gandhi joined the Indian independence movement in 1919, Rajagopalachari became one of
                    his followers. He participated in the Non-Cooperation movement and gave up his law practice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1921: </strong>
                    In 1921, he was elected to the Congress Working Committee and served as the General Secretary of the
                    party.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1924-1925: </strong>
                    He was also involved in the Vaikom Satyagraha movement against untouchability during 1924â€“25.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1930: </strong>
                    When Gandhi organised the Dandi march in 1930, Rajagopalachari broke the salt laws at Vedaranyam,
                    near Nagapattinam, along with Indian independence activist Sardar Vedaratnam and was afterwards
                    imprisoned by the British. He was subsequently elected President of the Tamil Nadu Congress
                    Committee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1937: </strong>
                    Following enactment of the Government of India Act in 1935, Rajagopalachari was instrumental in
                    getting the Indian National Congress to participate in the 1937 general elections. The Indian
                    National Congress first came to power in the Madras Presidency (also called Madras Province by the
                    British), following the Madras elections of 1937. Except for a six-year period when Madras was under
                    the governor's direct rule, the Congress administered the presidency until India became independent
                    on 15 August 1947. At the age of 59, Rajagopalachari won the Madras University seat and entered
                    the Assembly as the first Premier of the Madras Presidency from the Congress party.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1939: </strong>
                    Rajagopalachari issued the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act 1939, under which
                    restrictions were removed on Dalits and Shanars entering Hindu temples. In the same year, the
                    Meenakshi temple at Madurai was also opened to the Dalits and Shanars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1940: </strong>
                    Rajagopalachari's tenure as Chief Minister of Madras is largely remembered for the compulsory
                    introduction of Hindi in educational institutions, which made him highly unpopular. This measure
                    sparked off widespread anti-Hindi protests, which led to violence in some places and the jailing of
                    over 1,200 men, women and children who took part in the unrest. In 1940, Congress ministers resigned
                    in protest over the declaration of war on Germany without their
                    consent, leaving the governor to take over the reins of the administration. On 21 February 1940 the
                    unpopular new law on the use of Hindi was quickly repealed by the Governor of Madras. Despite
                    its numerous shortcomings, Madras under Rajagopalachari was still considered by political historians
                    as the best administered province in British India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1944: </strong>
                    Rajaji was instrumental in initiating negotiations between Gandhi and Jinnah. In 1944, he
                    proposed a solution to the Indian Constitutional tangle. In the same year, he proposed an
                    "absolute majority" threshold of 55 per cent when deciding whether a district should become part of
                    India or Pakistan, triggering a huge controversy among nationalists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1946-1947: </strong>
                    From 1946 to 1947, Rajagopalachari served as the Minister for Industry, Supply, Education, and
                    Finance in the Interim Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1947-1948: </strong>
                    When India and Pakistan attained independence on 15 August 1947, the British province of Bengal was
                    partitioned into two, with West Bengal becoming part of India and East Bengal part of Pakistan.
                    Supported by Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajagopalachari was appointed first Governor of West Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1948-1950: </strong>
                    From 10 until 24 November 1947, Rajagopalachari served as Acting Governor-General of India in the
                    absence of the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, who was on leave in England to attend the marriage
                    of Princess Elizabeth to Mountbatten's nephew Prince Philip. Rajagopalachari led a very simple
                    life in the viceregal palace, washing his own clothes and polishing his own shoes. Impressed
                    with his abilities, Mountbatten made Rajagopalachari his second choice to succeed him after
                    Vallabhbhai Patel, when he was to leave India in June 1948. Rajagopalachari was eventually
                    chosen as the governor-general when Nehru disagreed with Mountbatten's first choice, as did Patel
                    himself. He was initially hesitant but accepted when Nehru wrote to him, "I hope you will not
                    disappoint us. We want you to help us in many ways. The burden on some of us is more than we can
                    carry." Rajagopalachari then served as Governor-General of India from June 1948 until 26 January
                    1950, and was not only the last Governor-General of India, but the only Indian national ever to hold
                    the office.

                    <strong>1948-1950: </strong>
                    When India and Pakistan attained independence on 15 August 1947, the British province of Bengal was
                    partitioned into two, with West Bengal becoming part of India and East Bengal part of Pakistan.
                    Supported by Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajagopalachari was appointed first Governor of West Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1951: </strong>
                    By the end of 1951, the differences between Nehru and Rajagopalachari came to the fore. While
                    Nehru perceived the Hindu Mahasabha to be the greatest threat to the nascent republic,
                    Rajagopalachari held the opinion that the Communists posed the greatest danger. He also
                    adamantly opposed Nehru's decision to commute the death sentences passed on those involved in the
                    Telangana uprising and his strong pro-Soviet leanings. Tired of being persistently
                    over-ruled by Nehru with regard to critical decisions, Rajagopalachari submitted his resignation
                    on the "grounds of ill-health" and returned to Madras.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1952-1954: </strong>
                    During Rajagopalachari's tenure as Chief Minister, a powerful movement for a separate Andhra State,
                    comprising the Telugu-speaking districts of the Madras State, gained a foothold. On 19
                    October 1952, an Indian independence activist and social worker from Madras named Potti Sriramulu
                    embarked on a hunger strike reiterating the demands of the separatists and calling for the inclusion
                    of Madras city within the proposed state. Rajagopalachari remained unmoved by
                    Sriramulu's action and refused to intervene. After fasting for days, Sriramulu eventually
                    died on 15 December 1952, triggering riots in Madras city and the Telugu-speaking districts of the
                    state. Initially, both Rajagopalachari and Prime Minister Nehru were against the
                    creation of linguistically demarcated states but as the law and order situation in the state
                    deteriorated, both were forced to accept the demands. Andhra State was thus created on 1 October
                    1953 from the Telugu-speaking districts of Madras, with its capital at Kurnool.

                <li>
                    <strong>1955: </strong>
                    Following his resignation as Chief Minister, Rajagopalachari took a temporary break from active
                    politics and instead devoted his time to literary pursuits. He wrote a Tamil re-telling of the
                    Sanskrit epic Ramayana which appeared as a serial in the Tamil magazine Kalki from 23 May 1954 to 6
                    November 1955. The episodes were later collected and published as Chakravarthi Thirumagan, a
                    book which won Rajagopalachari the 1958 Sahitya Academy award in Tamil language. On
                    Republic Day 1955, Rajagopalachari was honoured with India's highest civilian award, the Bharat
                    Ratna.
